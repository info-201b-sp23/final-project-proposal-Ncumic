## Proposal

1. Introduction  

> Briefly introduce your project.  Include 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? (at least 200 words)

- Introduction: A lot of data revolving around earthquakes is confined to datasets and not very accessible to people unfamiliar to data traversal. Our objective is to better visualize this data for people that wish to stay informed, but can’t take the time to sift through data about earthquakes. This also helps people understand the actual frequencies and magnitude of earthquakes, and why earthquakes are not something to be as feared as they are depicted in movies and on the news. This data also has a unique column that goes over what citizens of a certain area felt like the magnitude of the earthquake was, this information if taken into account could also lower peoples worries of earthquakes and keep them more informed on earthquake impacts. Another good thing for people to understand about earthquakes are other variables that happen alongside the event and how they effect the environment around them, since many people don’t understand the aftermath/effects earthquakes bring(that is why we are also focusing on how many of these earthquakes cause tsunamis, or damage building around them). We intend to put a more clear understanding of these natural phenomena inorder to better reassure people and to inform.

1. What are the magnitudes and locations of earthquakes happening around the world?
2. What are the differences between earthquakes with different alert levels?
3. What is the frequency of earthquakes happening in each country?
4. What frequency of earthquakes causes tsunamis?

2. Related Work  

> Describe your topic and related work in this space. You must include 3 citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, research papers, etc. ) Please use a standard citation style of your choice. (at least 200 words)

The topic of earthquake data visualization has gained significant attention in recent years due to the increasing frequency and severity of earthquakes worldwide. One of the challenges associated with earthquake data is its vastness and complexity, making it difficult for the general public to comprehend. To address this issue, researchers have developed various tools and techniques to visualize earthquake data in an accessible and understandable format.

One example of related work is the Earthquake Visualization Project developed by the IRIS Consortium, which provides a comprehensive database of earthquake data and various visualization tools to analyze the data. The project offers interactive maps and timelines that enable users to explore earthquake data by location, magnitude, and depth. (IRIS Consortium, 2021)

Another example is the Global Earthquake Explorer (GEE), developed by the US Geological Survey, which provides real-time seismic data and visualization tools for earthquakes and other geophysical events. GEE allows users to analyze earthquake data in various formats, including maps, waveforms, and cross-sections. (USGS, 2021)

Additionally, a research paper by Fokaefs et al. (2020) explores the use of virtual reality (VR) technology to visualize earthquake data. The authors developed a VR application that allows users to explore earthquake data in a 3D environment, providing a more immersive and interactive experience than traditional visualization methods.

Overall, the research in earthquake data visualization has provided various tools and techniques to make earthquake data more accessible and understandable to the general public. These efforts can aid in educating individuals about the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes and help to alleviate fear surrounding these natural events.

3. The Dataset

> Where did you find the data? Please include a link to the data source 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/warcoder/earthquake-dataset

> Who collected the data?  

Chirag Chauhan

> How was the data collected or generated? 

Through seismic sensors near/at the location

> Why was the data collected? 

For scientists to see trends in earthquakes and fault lines

>How many observations (rows) are in your data? 

782 rows

> How many features (columns) are in the data?  

19 columns

> What, if any, ethical questions or questions of power do you need to consider when working with this data?

Data privacy - It includes information about the location and damage of the earthquake. We should consider the affected individuals before using the data.

> What are possible limitations or problems with this data?   (at least 200 words)

The earthquake dataset from Kaggle has the following problems and limitations such as limited coverage, incomplete data, and potential data quality issue. The dataset only includes earthquake data from Japan. This implies the data can not represent the earthquakes that happen in other regions. Second, the dataset doesn’t include all the earthquakes that has happened in Japan. It only includes the earthquakes that happened from 2000 to 2016. Furthermore, this dataset is collected from multiple sources, which may be collected through different methods and standards. Thus, the data may lead to inconsistencies and issues. In addition, the dataset is also lack of some contextual information. This contextual information covers details such as geological and environmental reason that cause the earthquake to happen. This information is important because it gives people a better understanding of factors that contribute to earthquakes. Other than this, the dataset also didn’t include how the people respond to the earthquake and the recovery effort they paid.

One another main limitation is that the accuracy of earthquake data can be affected by the changes of monitoring technology and techniques over time. As the newest methods for detecting and measuring earthquakes are developed, the historical data may become less accurate and reliable compared to the more recent data.

4. Implications

> Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly describe the expected or possible implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. (at least 150 words)

Scientists can use data and information on earthquake magnitudes and locations to improve earthquake prediction systems and develop earthquake-resistant buildings. Additionally, scientists can use the data on the differences between earthquakes with different alert levels to develop better early warning systems that can provide people in affected areas with timely alerts. As for designers, they can use the earthquake frequency data from each country to create infrastructure and structures that can survive the most common types of earthquakes in those areas. They can also use data on the frequency of earthquakes that trigger tsunamis to improve evacuation strategies and emergency response systems. Based on the data mentioned above, such as earthquake frequencies and magnitudes, politicians can make informed decisions on catastrophe risk reduction, emergency response planning, and resource allocation in earthquake-prone areas. They can also utilize the data to design building codes and regulations to promote public safety. All in all, if all the research questions are answered correctly, the study questions can provide valuable information for technologists, designers, and policymakers to improve earthquake prediction, disaster response, and public safety.

5. Limitations & Challenges
>What challenges or limitations might you need to address with your project idea more broadly? Briefly discuss. (at least 150 words)

Some challenges we might need to address when diving deeper into our project idea is what information is truly helpful for people to know, what information is best to display and focus on if our main goal is to inform, and dispel concerns. Our challenges will mostly focus around the way we decide what data is important and what is not(a lot like the book we are reading for this class). We will need to look into how certain data can be used to reach our goal considering there is a lot of data. Some limitations we might face is how we will limit our data(whether that be to a certain country or continent) and if we want to cross-examine data from other sources, how will we do that efficiently and reasonably? We need to understand our focus group even more in order to better sift through data and better reach our intended audience. Another limitation will be how accurate the data is or if all seismic sensors record even data.
